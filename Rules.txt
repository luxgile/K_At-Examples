K@ pronounced "cat", can be typed as well as K_At

1. In between C# and C++
    1.1 Unmanaged & Managed Code (The latter, later on.)
    1.2 Typed language
    1.3 Object Oriented Programming

2. Avoid Nulls
3. Choose if stack or heap
4. Pointers cannot be modified
    4.1 No offseting with ++ --
    4.2 No changing address of a defined pointer
    4.3 Pointers always need to point to something, you cannot declare a pointer from nowhere.
    4.4 Since you cannot modify them, assigning to a pointer will give the value to the value of the pointer
        {
            Int i = 5;
            Int* i_pointer = &i;
            i_pointer = 2;
            
            Person person = ();
            Person* person_pointer = &person;
            //Here, "person" now is a new object.
            person_pointer = ("Ben", 15);
        }
5. All code must be inside a library.
